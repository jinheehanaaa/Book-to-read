# Centralized

# Distributed
- Everyone collectively execute the job

# A Very Simplified Look of the Blockchain
- Every node maintains a local copy of the global data-sheet
- Local copy = Public Ledger

# Ensure a number of different aspects
## Protocols for Commitment
- During transaction time, ensure that the transaction is commited to existing public ledger
- Validity checking is required
## Consensus
- Everyone has the most updated copy
## Security
- Tamper proof
## Privacy and Authenticity
- Because the transactions belong to various clients

# Blockchain Definition
- Open distributed ledger (Accessible to all)
- Distributed or Decentralized (No single party control)
