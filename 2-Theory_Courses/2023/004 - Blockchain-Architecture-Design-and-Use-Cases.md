# Centralized
- Single point of failure

# Decentralized
- Multiple points of coordination

# Distributed
- Everyone collectively execute the job

# A Very Simplified Look of the Blockchain
- Every node maintains a local copy of the global data-sheet
- Local copy = Public Ledger

# Ensure a number of different aspects
## Protocols for Commitment
- During transaction time, ensure that the transaction is commited to existing public ledger
- Validity checking is required
## Consensus
- Everyone has the most updated copy
## Security
- Tamper proof
## Privacy and Authenticity
- Because the transactions belong to various clients

# Blockchain Definition
- Open distributed ledger (Accessible to all)
- Distributed or Decentralized (No single party control)
- Efficient transactions (Fash and scalable)
- Verifiable (Everyone can check the validity of information)
- Tamper-proof (Once you have inserted information into blockchain, you will not be able to update that information)

# Hash Functions
- H(x) = x % n
- Cryptographically Secured
- - One way
- - If x1 != x2, then H(x1) != H(x2)

# Avalanche effect
- A small change in the data results in a significant change in the ouput

# time-stamp a digital document
- Harber and Stornetta, 1991 for more information
- For securing digital document
# Merkle Trees
- Can secure multiple documents
- Peer to Peer Networks: Other peers do not lie about a block
- Bitcoin implemenation: No one can lie about a transaction

# Blockchain & Bitcoin
## Biotcoin
- Completely decentralized
- Peer-to-peer
- Permissionless
