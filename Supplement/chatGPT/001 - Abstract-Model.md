# Abstract Model with House Price (What exactly is Abstract Model?)
I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that features are typically concrete and measurable characteristics of the data, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and age of the house.

In the context of machine learning, the abstract or conceptual features of the data refer to the relationships or patterns that exist between these features, rather than the specific values of each feature. These relationships or patterns can be more difficult to measure or observe directly, but they are important for making predictions and generalizing to new data.

For example, in the house price prediction example, the abstract or conceptual features might include relationships such as:

    Houses with more bedrooms tend to be more expensive
    Houses with larger square footage tend to be more expensive
    Houses in certain neighborhoods or locations tend to be more expensive
    Houses that are newer tend to be more expensive

These relationships are abstract in the sense that they are not directly observable or measurable, but they are important for predicting the price of a house based on its features.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the concept of abstract or conceptual features in machine learning. Let me know if you have any further questions!
