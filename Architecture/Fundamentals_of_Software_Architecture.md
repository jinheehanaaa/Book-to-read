# Expectations of an Architect
- Architecture Decisions (Ex: use a reactive-based framework for frontend web development)
- Analyze the Architecture (Ex: Analyze and recommend solutions for improvement)
- Keep Current with Latest Trends
- Ensure Compliance with Decisions (EX: Presentation layer must not access DB)
- Diverse Exposure and Experience (EX: technical breadth > technical depth)
- Have Business Domain Knowledge
- Possess Interpersonal Skills
- Understand and Navigate Politics

# Intersection of Architecture and..
- Elastic Scale & PETS.COM' mascot
# Engineering Practices
- Estimation (How much time, How many resources, How much money?)
- fitness functons
# Operations/DevOps
- ESB-driven SOA
# Process
- Agile methodologies
# Data
- External storage

# Laws of Software Architecture
- 1. Trade-off
- 2. Why is more important than how
- To understand important trade-offs in architecture, developers must understand some basic concepts and terminology concerning components, moularity, coupling, and connascence

<summary>2. Architectural Thinking</summary>

# Architecture Versus Design
- No virtual barrier between architect & development team

# Technical Breadth
- As an architect, breadth is more important than depth

# Analyzing Trade-Offs
## Bid & Auction Example (Topic vs. Queue)
### Topic:
- Easy Implementation
- less data security
- Only supports homogeneous contracts
- No monitoring of the # of messages in the topics
### Queue:
- Difficult Implementation
- More data security
- Its own contract specific to the data
- Each queue can be monitored individually

# Understanding Business Drivers
- Scalability
- Performance
- Availability

# Balancing Architecture and Hands-On Coding
- Production code
- proof-of-concepts
- - The architect should write the best production-quality code t hey can
- Bug fixes within an iteration
- Leveraging automation by creating simple command-line tools (Look for repetitive tasks)
- - EX: Automated source validator
- - EX: Automated checklists
- - EX: Repetitive manual code refactoring tasks
- Frequent Code Review
